# EPSTLSTM
What is the code?
This code is for the Raman-based identification of therapeutic monoclonal antibodies using an extreme point sort transformation combined with a long short-term memory network algorithm. The introduction of extreme point sort transformation combined with a long short-term memory network algorithm can be found in the article entitled “Extreme point sort transformation combined with a long short-term memory network algorithm for the Raman-based identification of therapeutic monoclonal antibodies”, which is published in Frontiers in Chemistry.

How to use?
1.	Build an environment for model training. The requirements of both hardware and software can be found in the Method section of the article. The environment is OK if the code can run in its entirety.
2.	Prepare your Raman spectrum CSV files exported from a ThermoFisher DXR Raman spectrometer. Build your own database for model training. Revise the code for model training, then train your own models for identification. Notice that, the original Raman spectrum data of therapeutic mAbs and models are NOT provided in this project. Because we have no rights to publish the original spectra of the commercial therapeutic mAbs. This project is to introduce how extreme point sort transformation combined with a long short-term memory network algorithm works and for research purpose ONLY. 
3.	Optimize the parameters to obtain a best result of identification.
4.	Use the code to predict your samples.
